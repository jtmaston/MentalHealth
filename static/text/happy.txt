My, my, look who's here! What a good day to see you! How about some tunes? I know you love 'em. Maybe you'll tell me about your day?
Hello, hello! Looks like your life's going great! Amazin'! Remember these happy times, and whenever you feel sad, try to come back to them!
Heya, heya! Looking good, looking good! How do I know? I'm a machine, I'm supposed to know everything! Hehe.
Good day to you, fellow friend! Such a beautiful day... I think. It's great to see that you're happy. Some tunes?
Hey! Welcome back. Seems like you've been having a great time recently. Keep it up!
Yo! What's new on the block? Nothing? This ain't the nineties anymore? Pfff...
