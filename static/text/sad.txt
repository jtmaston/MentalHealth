Hey. Looks like you're not feeling so good. Don't sweat it. You'll pull through. Life is like the sea. Sometimes welcoming, sometimes hellish, but always beautiful.
Hello there! Seems that you're not at your best... Smile! Tomorrow's another day! Try to dwell on the things that make you smile everyday.
Whoop-dee-doop! Have you called your best friend Betty? What? You don't have a best friend named Betty? Oh, well... Give your best friend a call...
Howdy! I'm the voice that lives inside this website. Don't believe me? Well then, who's talking to you right now? Oh, well...
G'day! Look outside your window. What's the weather like? I can't see, but how about you describe it to me? I love clouds.
Heya, what's popping? Not much, not much? Chill out to some tunes, then. It's a great way to relax. Empty your mind. Think of nothing.
